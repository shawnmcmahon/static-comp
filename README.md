# Static Comp

### Description
The mission of Static Comp is to test our ability to replicate a comp given to
us in a short amount of time. The 'Original Comp Screenshot' below displays
the minimum standards the comp was required to encompass. We were given creative
liberty to change the topic, colors, and icons of the comp as long as replicated
the original comps design. The final results are displayed in the 'Final
Product Screenshot' section below.


### How it Works
- Run 'Git clone git@github.com:shawnmcmahon/static-comp.git' in the command line.
- Run 'Open index.html' in the console
- Review comp from the webpage that appears

### Technologies Implemented
- Node.js
- HTML/CSS
- Normalize.css


### Future Updates
- Replace emojis that don't work other browsers with google image icons.
- Fix logo position to flex to the end of the nav on all resolutions
- Add subs and most views pages

### Contributors
